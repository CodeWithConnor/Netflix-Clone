## Description

In this project, I utilized the TMDb API to retrieve information on various movies and TV shows, including titles, descriptions and poster images. I also used Axios to handle API requests and CSS for styling.

One of the main challenges I faced during development was ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience, as well as optimizing the performance of the application. To achieve this, I made use of React's virtual DOM and lazy loading techniques to efficiently render and update the UI.

## How to Run The Project Locally

To run the project locally, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root project directory.
2. [Register for your own API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) from TMDb and replace the sample key in the requests.js file.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.
